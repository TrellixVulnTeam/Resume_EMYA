Emma to help Jessica with implementing booking function and appointments page. 
YoungGil and Pawanjot to work together on merging the HTML written by Pawanjot with YoungGil's login system. 
Sam to finalise search function after discussing his queries.

The importance of teamwork was highlighted as some members struggled with the implementation of their code. This taught us a valuable lesson about the real world work environment which will help prepare us for the work force.

General Description:
 - Sam finished implementing the search function after clarifying his doubts.
 - Pawanjot and Younggil worked together in merging the HTML and finished implementing the login system.
 - Emma and Jess started working on booking and appointments
 - Bugs for search and login were fixed and manually tested to ensure that they were correctly implemented. We programmed together for an hour so that we could interact with each other in a team environment and this ensured that problems and doubts were resolved much quicker.
 
Obstacles Encountered:
 - Bugs encountered in search and login functions
 - Uncertainty over how to start implement the booking function
 
Obstacles Overcome:
 - Bugs in search and login were fixed
 - Team members shared ideas and worked in collaboration with each other and started developing the booking function.
 
Milestones Achieved:
 - Finished the search and login functions
 
 Emma and Jess to continue working on booking and appointments.
 Younggil to work on implementing a database and rating.
 Pawanjot to work on routes.py and synergising all the features as well as viewing health and provider profiles.
 Sam to work on logbook and velocity chart as well as tests for search.
 Until the next meeting team members will work on their assigned tasks and meet later on this week to discuss our progress.

**28/09/18 (Friday)**


* Discussed where team members were with their current tasks and finished implementing view helath centre and provider profiles as well as providing rating for providers and health centres. Over the last few meetings we realised the importance of wroking together as a team in order to finish large programming projects like this on time, and because team members had time, we decided to code together in order to finish the user stories, with success.

Obstacles Encountered:
 - Bugs detected in the search program
 - Needed to change how a few functions in route.py were implemented in order to finish view health centre and providers properly

Obstacles Overcome:
 - Managed to fix the bugs in the search program and ensured that it worked perfectly for all test cases.
 - Managed to finish four user stories and insure their implementation was correct.
 
Milestones Achieved:
 - Finished implementaton of view health centres and providers
 - Implemented function to provide rating for providers and health centres 
 
 Emma and Jess to continue working on booking and appointments.
 Younggil to work on implementing a database to store all the data.
 Sam to start writing tests for history and search.
 Pawanjot to help Sam with testing and Emma and Jess with booking
 
 * The goal is to finish all user stories/features by the end of the midsem break and before the next team meeting.
 * As most team members are busy with exams and assignments, the meeting will be held in mid-week 11, where debugging and ensuring that the functions are implemented properly will commence.
 * Proceeding this, testing using pytest and writing test cases will commence.

**10/10/2018 (Wednesday)**
General Description:
